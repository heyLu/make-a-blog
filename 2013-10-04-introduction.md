# What is this going to be like?

We're going to build a little *hacker blog*, that is, just HTML + CSS and
maybe a tiny bit of JavaScript.

Your blog posts will be written in Markdown, a little language that lets
you write simple text and output HTML for you. So you can just write what's
on your mind and only later add formatting, pretty links and images or
whatever else.

So, here's what your blog will be like:

* simple (HTML + CSS)
* just text (e.g. you write blog posts as text files, in any Editor you like)
* whatever you want (comments, categories, photo-blog, whatever really)

Oh, and it will be online a few minutes from now. That might sound a little
bit scary, but we're all quite friendly and want to help you. And maybe we'll
enjoy reading about your adventures thoughts or whatever.

Any way, the first post isn't far away.
